# OKN KG registry

## KG registry entries
Source files for registry entries can be found here:

https://github.com/frink-okn/okn-registry/tree/main/docs/registry/kgs

The Markdown file for each KG is the source of truth; these are automatically compiled into the
[registry metadata file](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/frink-okn/okn-registry/refs/heads/main/docs/registry/kgs.yaml).
Each Markdown file contains a YAML metadata section at the top, which should use standardized properties (a schema is forthcoming for use in QC).
The remaining Markdown content can be used to provide a narrative overview of the KG.

If you are a Proto-OKN KG maintainer, please propose edits to your registry file in a 
[pull request](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/about-pull-requests).
