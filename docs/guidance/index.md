# Best Practice Guidelines for Knowledge Graph Construction

Here are links to two documents developed in collaboration with EduGate (Theme 3) and SPIDER (Theme 2) to support Theme 1 groups in enhancing the integrity of knowledge graphs and advancing their interoperability. 

If you would like to discuss these documents, ask questions, or suggest new topics that should be addressed, please visit us on the #kg-development-qa channel in the Proto-OKN Slack.
