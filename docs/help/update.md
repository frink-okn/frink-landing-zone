# Update Your Graph in FRINK


## Notifying FRINK On Data Updates
!!! warning inline    "Note"

    When doing merges please ensure that main branch is going to end up having only data that you'd want to make available. Datafiles from previous versions, that are no longer needed should be removed from develop branch before merging. FRINK will have no way of telling which ones are the right files.     


Merging your data from develop branch to main branch will be observed by the FRINK team (currently developing automations), 
do deploy your data and make it queryable.
