# About FRINK
Knowledge graphs have emerged in many domains of science and technology as a powerful means of integrating, structuring, and mining information to extract new knowledge. To fully realize the promise of these knowledge graphs, a concerted effort is needed to synthesize many independently modeled and developed graphs that overlap partially with each other, in terms of their content. The Fabric Integrating Networked Knowledge, FRINK, is a project that meets this challenge by creating capabilities that allow for the uniform deployment, integration, and harmonization of knowledge graphs created under the Proto-OKN program into a unified Open Knowledge Network for query and analysis. 

The FRINK project is supported by NSF ITE 2333810.
