# FRINK: Integrating Knowledge in the Prototype Open Knowledge Network (Proto-OKN) Program

In collaboration with five other U.S. government agencies, the U.S. [National Science Foundation](https://nsf.org) (NSF) has [invested $26.7 million in 18 projects through its Building the Prototype Open Knowledge Network (Proto-OKN) program](https://new.nsf.gov/tip/updates/nsf-invests-first-ever-prototype-open-knowledge-network). NASA, NIH, the National Institute of Justice, NOAA and the U.S. Geological Survey are partnering with NSF on this effort and will work closely with the awardees to ensure that Proto-OKN supports each agencyâ€™s data strategy while addressing use cases associated with agency data. 

An *open knowledge network* is a publicly accessible system of interconnected data repositories and knowledge graphs, designed to support data-driven, AI-powered solutions to societal and economic challenges. *Knowledge graphs* facilitate the integration, structuring, and analysis of information across various scientific and technological domains.

Among the 18 Proto-OKN projects, the Fabric Integrating Networked Knowledge (FRINK) focuses on synthesizing the independently developed graphs within Proto-OKN, enabling seamless deployment, integration, harmonization, and analysis of knowledge across these graphs. For more information about the larger program, visit the main Proto-OKN website: [https://www.proto-okn.net/](https://www.proto-okn.net/)

This website serves as a resource for Theme 1 participants in the Proto-OKN program and provides information on FRINK's work for the broader public. The Quick Start Guide provides help information for Theme 1 participants developing graphs for the Proto-OKN, Best Practices guidance for Theme 1 participants, and the OKN Registry containing detailed information about each Theme 1 graph. 

The FRINK project is supported by NSF ITE 2333810.
