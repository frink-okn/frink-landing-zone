# The Open Knowledge Network (OKN)

In collaboration with five other U.S. government agencies, the U.S. [National Science Foundation](https://nsf.org) has [invested $26.7 million in 18 projects through its Building the Prototype Open Knowledge Network (Proto-OKN) program](https://new.nsf.gov/tip/updates/nsf-invests-first-ever-prototype-open-knowledge-network). 

An open knowledge network is a publicly accessible, interconnected set of data repositories and associated knowledge graphs that will enable data-driven, artificial intelligence-based solutions for a broad set of societal and economic challenges. 

NASA, NIH, the National Institute of Justice, NOAA and the U.S. Geological Survey are partnering with NSF on this effort and will work closely with the awardees to ensure that Proto-OKN supports each agencyâ€™s data strategy while addressing use cases associated with agency data. An additional 15 U.S. federal and state agencies have shown interest in collaborating with the 18 awardees. FRINK is one such awardee.
