[Ubergraph](https://github.com/INCATools/ubergraph) is an RDF triplestore which provides a SPARQL query endpoint to an integrated suite of OBO ontologies, and includes precomputed inferred edges which allow logically complete queries over those ontologies for a subset of OWL. This Proto-OKN copy of the Ubergraph triplestore is provided by the NSF [FRINK](https://frink.renci.org) project.
